# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated**: December 2024

## Introduction

Carnatic Metronome ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## Information We Collect

### No Personal Information Collected

### Technical Information

The App may temporarily store the following information locally on your device:
- Your selected tala, nadai, tempo, and shruthi preferences (stored locally only)
- Your volume settings (stored locally only)

This information is stored only on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party.

## Third-Party Services

### AWS Services

The App uses the following AWS services to deliver audio content:

- **Amazon S3**: Used to stream audio files (mridangam recordings) to the App
- **Amazon Cognito**: Used for anonymous authentication to access AWS S3 resources

**Important**: 
- These services are used only to deliver audio content to the App
- No personal information is transmitted to AWS
- Audio files are loaded on-demand and cached locally on your device
- AWS does not have access to any personal information about you

- Your data remains private and secure on your device

## Children's Privacy

The App is suitable for users of all ages, including children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect personal information, there is no personal data for you to access, modify, or delete. All preferences and data are stored locally on your device and can be managed through your device settings.
